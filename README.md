# AeroRewards
This is my project for AeroLab Coding Challenge!
I was tasked to build a product grid for a reward program where the users can redeem items through a point-based system

## Main Goals
* Create a functional website to fullfill AeroLab requisites
* Implement useful technologies to achieve efficiency on the requested task
* Design a visually harmonious website, prioritizing good UX/UI patterns
* Make the website responsive to achieve maximum compatibility between devices  

## Tecnologies Used

* <strong>React.js:</strong> The UI was created with React.js Library, looking to keep it simple
* <strong>CSS:</strong> Following the simplistic approach I decided to use pure CSS for the styling
* <strong>Axios:</strong> I used Axios to handle the API requests due to its flexibility
* <strong>Redux:</strong> For the state managment Redux was implemented
* <strong>Font Awesome:</strong> I also use some icons from Font Awesome
